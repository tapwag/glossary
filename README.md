# glossary
A glossary for classic fantasy roleplaying games (mostly retro clones released under the Open Gaming Licence)

This is a glossary I have developed during the process of translating various 
Open Gaming Content for my roleplaying adventures to save me some time in
the long run of the translation process.

It is mostly intended for use with the free CAT-Tool "OmegaT" which you can
download from:

www.omegat.org

Implementing the glossary is fairly straightforward: Just copy the file to the
"glossary" tree structure of your project folder which is created after setting up 
the OmegaT translation-project directory tree.

Happy translating and let the good dice roll!
